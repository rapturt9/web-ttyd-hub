Web TTYd Hub is a web-based terminal session manager built on ttyd + tmux. Create, manage, and switch between multiple terminal sessions right from your browser -- whether you're at your desk or on your phone.

## Why

- A long-running task on your work machine, and you want to check on it from home?
- Lying in bed with a sudden idea to fix a bug, wishing you could just open a terminal?
- Out and about with only your phone, wanting to connect to your dev machine?

**Web TTYd Hub** turns your terminal into a web service. Open a browser, and you're in. Sessions never die.

## Features

- **Multi-session management** -- Create multiple independent terminal sessions, switch freely
- **Persistent sessions** -- Powered by tmux, sessions survive browser closures, reconnect anytime
- **Collaborative access** -- Multiple browsers can connect to the same session simultaneously
- **Multi-shell support** -- Choose from Bash, Zsh, Fish and more when creating a session
- **Mobile-friendly** -- Responsive UI that works smoothly on phones and tablets
- **Dark UI** -- Refined Slate/Zinc theme with smooth animations
- **Zero-config startup** -- One command to launch after installing dependencies

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **ttyd** -- Web terminal emulator
- **tmux** -- Terminal multiplexer
